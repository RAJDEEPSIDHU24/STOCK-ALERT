Setup and install it 

------------------------- Configure Environment Variables------------------------------------------------------


* Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory (the same level as app.py) and add the following, replacing the placeholder values:

FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=/full/path/to/your-project-id-firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx-xxxxxx.json
FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_WEB_API_KEY_FROM_FIREBASE_CONSOLE
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=a_very_long_and_random_secret_key_for_flask_sessions

FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH: The full path to the JSON file you downloaded above .

FIREBASE_API_KEY: The apiKey you copied in previous step

FLASK_SECRET_KEY: Generate a strong, random string for this (e.g., import os; print(os.urandom(24).hex()) in a Python console). This is important  for Flask session security.
